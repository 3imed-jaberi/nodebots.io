<h1>Dimensions</h1>
<p>Sumo bots must fit into an 6"x6"x6" cube. The "arena" will be a 3'-diameter circle on a flat surface.</p>

<h1>Competition rules</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Each match will consist of 3 rounds of 60 seconds each between 2 robots</li>
  <li>The winner of each match will compete against winners of other matches, until one robot is determined to be the Grand Champion Sumo Bot</li>
  <li>Points are only valid during a given match; they do not roll over into subsequent matches (i.e. every bot starts each match with 0 points)</li>
  <li>While damage/destruction is inevitable, it is not encouraged. Robots that purposely attempt to ruin their competition will be put in timeout with a professional finger-wagger for the remainder of the competition.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Scoring</h1>
<ul>
  <li>If a robot leaves the competition arena, the opposing robot wins the round</li>
  <li>The first robot to win 2 rounds winds the match
If neither robot wins the round, the match judge will choose the winner, based on something whimsical and/or random, probably style.</li>
</ul>
