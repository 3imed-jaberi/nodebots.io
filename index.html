<h3>WAT?</h3>
<p>NodeBots are robots that are controlled by node.js. A NodeBots event is a full day event where JS developers team up in groups of 3 with soldering guns nearby to create amazing robotic devices.</p>

<p>At a NodeBots event, teams of up to 3 people hack together Arduino based robots and program it all using just JavaScript! If you have no idea what an LED is or a resistor for that matter, have no fear - NodeBot experts will be readily available to help you hardware hack, solder, and 3D print your way to a full fledged NodeBot.</p>

<h3>Programming a NodeBot is Easy</h3>

<p>Install <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> and get the <a href="https://github.com/rwldrn/johnny-five">johnny-five</a> module. You need to have an Arduino programmed with Firmata, which is <a href="https://github.com/rwldrn/johnny-five#setup-and-assemble-arduino">pretty easy to setup</a>. Once that is complete, you can now start hacking hardware like a champion! NodeBots makes the process of programming hardware circuitry very similar to how one would program a modern web page. Seriously, it is that easy!</p>
