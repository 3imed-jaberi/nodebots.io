We were excited to have everyone at inaugural launch of NodeBots. Not only did our event fill up to capacity, we saw more crazy robot ideas come to fruition then we thought possible. On top of that everyone who attended were wonderful human begins. They were helpful to others, shared everything they learned and were there to build and hack. We even had a number of people stay to help cleanup afterwards.

We'd like to thank the NodeCopter team for being good sports about us shooting down a drone (It survived the crash ok!). You should probably check out the Missile Defense bot.

Everyone should thank [Bitovi](http://bitovi.com/) for sponsoring our event. We were able to do a lot more with their help. They also made the ingenious TP Bot.

## The Event
JSConf set us up in one of "Omni Amelia Island Plantation Resort's" conference room. It was huge, had lots of tables and was right next to the [NodeCopter Event](http://nodecopter.com/2013/amelia-island/may-30).

 - We started our event with a presentation on Johnny-Five, the node library that allows us to control our Arduinos.
 - While we weren't able to give out the parts we can tell you what they were. [JSConf Parts List](parts.md)
 - Some people made use of Kinematics, which [Raquel](https://twitter.com/rockbot) presented to everybody in her [AI.js talk](https://speakerdeck.com/rockbot/ai-dot-js-robots-with-brains) the day before.

## The Parts

 - The [Arduino Uno](http://www.adafruit.com/products/50) of course, which we all received as a nice surprise from JSConf!
 - Sumo Bots had a [Parallax BOEBot Robot for Arduino Kit](http://www.adafruit.com/products/749) as it's core
 - The most used parts turned out to be Popsicle sticks and hot glue
 - We had a large collection of [Continuous Servos](http://www.adafruit.com/products/154), [Standard Servos](http://www.adafruit.com/products/155). [Micro Servos](http://www.adafruit.com/products/169) came with the...
 - [SparkFun Inventor's Kit for Arduino](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11227) which we highly recommend for anyone who wants to start building at home and doesn't know what to get.
 - [Arduino Tinker Kits](http://store.arduino.cc/ww/index.php?main_page=index&cPath=16_17) which included a large collection of sensors, inputs and LEDs.
